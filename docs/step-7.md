## Step 7: Use a service to get data

This step converts Step 6's example to use a service
(NamesService) to load and provide names.

_**Keywords**: service_

### Create a service

In Step 4, we hard coded data in our controller. In Step 5, we added
functionality to read the data from a JSON file. In this step, we move all
aspects of fetching a pirate name out of the controller and into a service.
This creates a clean separation of logic in our app: the model defines the
shape of our data, the service provides the actual data, and the controller is
the glue that keeps everything together.

In the location that you created the `badge/` directory in Step 4, create a
new directory and call it `service`. In this directory, create a new file,
`names_service.dart`, and copy the following content to it:

```Dart
library ng_dart_codelab.names_service;

import 'package:angular/angular.dart';
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:math';

@NgInjectableService()
class NamesService {
  static final Random rand = new Random();
  final Http _http;
  List<String> names;
  List<String> appellations;

  NamesService(this._http);

  Future _loadData() {
    if (names != null) return new Future.value(true);
    return _http.get('piratenames.json')
      .then((HttpResponse response) {
        names = response.data['names'];
        appellations = response.data['appellations'];
      })
      .catchError((error) {
        print('Could not read data from the JSON file: $error');
      });
  }

  Future<String> randomName() {
    return _loadData().then((_) => _oneRandom(names));
  }

  Future<String> randomAppellation() {
    return _loadData().then((_) => _oneRandom(appellations));
  }

  String _oneRandom(List<String> list) => list[rand.nextInt(list.length)];
}
```

We create a `NamesService` class and move much of the Step 6 controller logic
into this class:

* You've moved the `names` and `appellations` lists here
* You've copied over the `_oneRandom()` method over verbatim, and you've
defined the `randomName()` and `randomAppellation()` helper methods to fetch
random data selections.
* You've redefined the `_loadData()` method and introduced an optimization:
the method now checks if the `names` list has already been populated and
fetches data only if it hasn't. As a result, you can call `randomName()` and
`randomAppellation()` without loading up the JSON data every time.

Note the `@NgInjectableService` annotation for the `NamesService` class? When
applied to a class, this annotation indicates that the class will be
instantiated by Angular's dependency injector. We'll get to plugging that in
later in this step.


### Clean up the controller

First, add the following import statement along with the other import statements
at the top:

```Dart
// ...
import 'service/names_service.dart';
// ...
```

Don't worry about the 'Unused Warning' from the Editor. We'll fix that soon
enough.

Much of the Step 6 controller logic relating to fetching data can now be
stripped away. Replace your controller from the previous step with this
version:

```Dart
@NgController(
    selector: '[badges]',
    publishAs: 'ctrl')
class BadgesController {
  NamesService ns;

  PirateName pn = new PirateName();

  String get pirateName => pn.firstName.isEmpty ? '' :
    '${pn.firstName} the ${pn.appellation}';

  BadgesController(this.ns);

  String _name = '';

  get name => _name;

  set name(newName) {
    _name = newName;
    ns.randomAppellation().then((appellation) {
      pn..firstName = newName
        ..appellation = appellation;
    });
  }

  bool get inputIsNotEmpty => name.trim().isNotEmpty;

  String get label => inputIsNotEmpty ? "Arrr! Write yer name!" :
    "Aye! Gimme a name!";

  generateName() {
    ns.randomName().then((_name) {
      name = _name;
    });
  }
}
```
You've added a `NamesService` instance as a field to the controller:

```Dart
  NamesService ns;
```

You've changed the `name` setter to use the service to construct the pirate
name:

```Dart
set name(newName) {
  _name = newName;
  ns.randomAppellation().then((appellation) {
    pn..firstName = newName
      ..appellation = appellation;
  });
```

And you've modified `generateName()` to also use the service:

```Dart
generateName() {
  ns.randomName().then((_name) {
    name = _name;
  });
```

Note that `generateName()` first fetches a random name and then calls on
`set name()` to fetch a random appellation.

The controller now has no knowledge of how the data is generated, but can
request it from the service when needed.

Since the code for picking random values has been moved to the service, you
can remove this unused import:

```Dart
import 'dart:math' show Random;
```

### Use the service

Add the `NamesService` type to `ngBootstrap()` to instantiate it using the
dependency injector, so that your `main()` now looks like this:

```Dart
void main() {
  ngBootstrap(module: new Module()
    ..type(BadgesController)
    ..type(NamesService)
    ..type(BadgeComponent));
}
```

### Update the UI

Notice that the `dataLoaded` field has been removed from the controller? You no
longer fetch data when the page loads, but instead wait for user action before
doing so. Update `pirateBadge.html` so that the markup for your input and
button look like this:

```HTML
<div class="widgets">
  <div>
    <input type="text" id="inputName" maxlength="15" ng-model="ctrl.name">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button ng-click="ctrl.generateName()"
        ng-disabled="ctrl.inputIsNotEmpty">
        {{ctrl.label}}</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

Save your changes and run your app.
